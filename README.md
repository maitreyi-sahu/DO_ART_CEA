**Cost-effectiveness of community-based ART compared with standard of care**

This repository includes model outputs for the DRIVE model (HIV incidence, HIV prevalence, and mortality) through 2060. Files cover 1925 to 2060, but projections begin at 2020.

"Scenario 1": Baseline HIV testing and quarterly clinic-based HIV care only 

"Scenario 2": Community-based home HIV testing and counselling (HTC) campaigns, conducted once every five years, 
              followed by quarterly  community-based ART delivery and monitoring for people who are not reached by the standard of care 

The 28 file columns are organized as follows: mean, min, max, 25 columns with the 25 best-fitting parameter sets. File names designate outcomes for males, females, or males and females combined, as well as an associated age range. Files with the prefix "raw" include counts over that time period.
