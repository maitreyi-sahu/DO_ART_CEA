"Scenario 1": Baseline HIV testing and quarterly clinic-based HIV care only 

"Scenario 2": Community-based home HIV testing and counselling (HTC) campaigns, conducted once every five years, 
              followed by quarterly  community-based ART delivery and monitoring for people who are not reached by the standard of care 

The 28 file columns are organized as follows: mean, min, max, 25 columns with the 25 best-fitting parameter sets
